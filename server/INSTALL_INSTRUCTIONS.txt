LEEDZ SERVER INSTALLATION GUIDE
====================================================================

12/2025: These instructions are temporary, until the Leedz is
registered with Google and available on the App Store.  Then the
install will be easier, but the program will be harder to update.
While the app is in beta, and we are taking your feature requests
and bug reports please endure this more cumbersome process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: DOWNLOAD AND EXTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download "leedz-server-win-x64.zip" from theleedz.com
2. Right-click the ZIP file and select "Extract All..."
3. Choose a permanent location (like C:\Program Files\Leedz)
   IMPORTANT: Don't delete this folder after installation - this is
   where your database and settings are stored!
4. Click "Extract"

You should see a folder containing:
  - TheLeedz.exe (System tray application)
  - leedz-server.exe (Backend server)
  - launch_leedz.bat (Startup script)
  - prisma/ folder (Database and schema)
  - server_config.json (Server settings)
  - img/ folder (Icons)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: START THE SERVER
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Double-click "launch_leedz.bat" in the extracted folder
2. A small icon will appear in your Windows system tray (bottom-right)
3. A command window will open showing "Server starting on port 3000..."
4. When you see "Server listening on port 3000", it's ready!

The system tray icon lets you quickly access server controls and
settings. Right-click the icon to see available options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: VERIFY IT'S WORKING
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The server is now running and ready to connect with your Chrome
extension. You can verify by:
  - Checking the system tray for the Leedz icon
  - The command window shows "Server listening on port 3000"

Leave the command window open while using Leedz. Closing it will
stop the server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4: CONNECT YOUR CHROME EXTENSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Now install the Leedz Chrome extension (see separate instructions).
The extension will automatically connect to your local server at
http://localhost:3000

--------------------------------------------------------------------
STOPPING AND RESTARTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------
TO STOP: Close the command window, or right-click the tray icon
and select "Exit"

TO RESTART: Double-click "launch_leedz.bat" again

TO AUTO-START ON WINDOWS BOOT (Optional):
1. Press Win+R, type "shell:startup", press Enter
2. Right-click in the Startup folder, select "New > Shortcut"
3. Browse to your launch_leedz.bat file
4. Click Next, then Finish

====================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
====================================================================

PORT ALREADY IN USE: If you see "Port 3000 is already in use",
another program is using that port. Either stop that program or
edit server_config.json to change the port number.

FIREWALL WARNING: Windows may ask to allow network access. Click
"Allow access" - the server only runs locally on your computer.

SERVER WON'T START: Make sure you extracted ALL files from the ZIP.
Try running as Administrator (right-click launch_leedz.bat, select
"Run as administrator").

EXTENSION CAN'T CONNECT: Verify the server is running (check for
the tray icon and command window). Make sure no firewall is blocking
localhost connections.

DATABASE ISSUES: Your database is stored in prisma/leedz.sqlite.
To backup your data, copy this file to a safe location.
